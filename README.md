This course entails the various programming methodologies and it explains the reasons that
each methodology is introduced.  

We studied various Programming paradigms:  
Structured programming, Functional Programming, Logic programming, Object Oriented
Programming, Component based Programming and Rapid application development (RAD).

We also learnt everything about Java except the networking part which is addressed in a later course.  
Here I will be uploading some Java programs I wrote.
